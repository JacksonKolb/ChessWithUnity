# Team Agreement
This section is intended to document the process that we've all agreed to.

## Ticketing Work In Jira
* All work is ticketed. If your current work doesn't fall into the scope of a ticket, ask Jack if a new ticket should
be created.

* All tickets have a point assigned to them, that the team agrees on. If anyone disagrees with a point sizing, we must
discuss until everyone agrees.

* As a general rule, we should avoid resizing tickets and adding more work to them after their initial creation.

* Branch names must be in this format: `SB-1`, `SB-10`, `SB-100` (SB = Sons of Bishops)

* Branch names must match the specific ticket number in our trello board.

## Code Review
* Each ticket's PR must be reviewed by the other two members of the team before it is merged.

* To approve a PR, we will leave comments that say `+1`
